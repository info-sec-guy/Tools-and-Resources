## Metrics and Reporting
* Reporting helps us get budget for tools, other resources and staff.
* Reporting is sometimes part of compliance/audit.
* Reporting makes our bosses happy and is a box we need to check. 
* We need metrics for *improvement*. 


## Metrics That Matter
* Time to detect
* Time to remediate and/pr patch
* Baseline security posture, how close are you to your goals? How much close 3,6,12 months later? 
* Are you meeting your SLAs with developers and ops? 
* Average number of vulnerabilities per system or app, and does this go down over time? 
* Detecting the same types of vulns? Reduction in #s?
* Are you now able to detect new types of vulns? 
* After education on specific topics do instances decline? 
* After targeting specific vulns do they decline? 

## Incident Metrics That Matter
Measuring Incidents
* Time to resolve
* Time to detect
* Time to diagnose as incident or just event (triage)
* Types/categories of incidents
* Process is/is not followed? 
* Cost & damage
* Types repeated, or new types found
* Other teams understand who to do/cooperative
* Post-mortem performed *every single time*?
* Quarterly review of incident stats? 
* TIme between incidents (if there's no recovery time that's an issue) - note on resting your staff 

## Improvement; Using Metrics
* Education on your top 3
* Bug type eradication
* Compliance (regs + your policies & standards)
* Are you meeting your SLAs? Bug Fixing SLAs?
* Are you repeating incidents? Finding new kinds?
